This code integrates the UI middleware NoesisGUI (http://www.noesisengine.com/noesis_gui_features.htm) with Ogre3D (http://www.ogre3d.org/) graphics rendering engine.

Being NoesisGUI still a beta binaries are not distributed here. These are the instructions that must be followed to add them to this code:

* Copy noesis.dll to bin\debug and bin\release
* Include headers must be copied to Dependencies\include
* noesis.lib must be copied to Dependencies\lib
